                        Progressive web apps use modern web APIs along with traditional progressive enhancement strategy to create cross-platform web applications. These apps work everywhere and provide several features that give them the same user experience advantages as native
                        apps.

                    <p class="text">Google uses a helpful acronym for us to understand why PWAs are so effective: FIRE – Fast, Integrated, Reliable, and Engaging. This acronym is itself a perfect explanation of why PWA is in trend amongst developers.</p>

                    <p class="text">PWAs are web apps developed using a number of specific technologies and standard patterns to allow them to take advantage of both web and native app features.</p>
                    <p class="text">For example, web apps are more discoverable — it's a lot easier and faster to visit a website than install an application, and you can also share web apps via a link.</p>
                    <p class="text">On the other hand, native apps are better integrated with the operating system and therefore offer a more seamless experience for the users. You can install a native app so that it works offline, and users love tapping their homescreen
                        icons to easily access their favorite apps, rather than navigating to it using a browser.</p>
                    <p class="text">PWAs give us the ability to create web apps that can enjoy these same advantages.</p>
                    <p class="text">It's not a brand new concept — such ideas have been revisited many times on the web platform with various approaches in the past. Progressive Enhancement and responsive design already allow us to build mobile friendly websites. Working
                        offline and installing apps was possible in the Firefox OS ecosystem a few years ago.</p>
                    <p class="text">PWAs, however, provide all this and more, without getting rid of any of the existing features that make the web great.</p>

                <div>
                    <p class="text">As we hinted at above, PWAs are not created with a single technology. They represent a new philosophy for building web apps, involving some specific patterns, APIs, and other features. It's not that obvious if a web app is a PWA or
                        not from first glance. An app could be considered a PWA when it meets certain requirements, or implements a set of given features: works offline, is installable, is easy to synchronize, can send push notifications, etc.</p>
                    <p class="text">In addition, there are tools to measure the completeness of an app in percentages. (Lighthouse is currently the most popular one.) By implementing various technological advantages, we can make an app more progressive, thus ending up
                        with a higher Lighthouse score. But this is only a rough indicator.</p>
                    <p class="text">There are some key principles a web app should try to observe to be identified as a PWA. It should be:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Discoverable, so the contents can be found through search engines.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Installable, so it's available on the device's home screen.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>Linkable, so you can share it by simply sending a URL.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <header>
                    <h2 class="title">Is it worth doing all that?</h2>
                </header>
                <div class="details">
                    <p class="text">Absolutely! With a relatively small amount of effort required to implement the core PWA features, the benefits are huge. For example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                A decrease in loading times after the app has been installed, thanks to caching with Service Workers, along with saving precious bandwidth and time. PWAs have near-instantaneous loading (from the second visit).
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                The ability to update only the content that has changed when an app update is available. In contrast, with a native app, even the slightest modification can force the user to download the entire application again.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                A look and feel that is more integrated with the native platform — app icons on the homescreen, apps that run fullscreen, etc.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>
                                Re-engaging with users via system notifications and push messages, leading to more engaged users and better conversion rates.
                            </p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p class="text">There are many success stories of companies trying the PWA route, opting for an enhanced website experience rather than a native app, and seeing significant measurable benefits as a result. The website PWA Stats shares many case studies
                        that indicate these benefits.
